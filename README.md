**Groq LLAMA3**
---------------

This is a simple chatbot built with Streamlit and powered by Groq’s LLaMA-3 models (llama3-8b-8192, llama3-70b-8192). It was originally made for OpenAI’s GPT models but later updated to use the Groq API, which is faster and free to start.

The app provides an interactive chatbot interface in the browser using Streamlit. Responses are generated by Groq’s LLaMA-3 models, making the chatbot lightweight and quick.

To use it, you need to install the dependencies, set up a Groq API key in a config.json file, and then run the Streamlit app. Once running, you can ask questions like “Who is Jon Snow in Game of Thrones?” and get direct answers from the LLaMA-3 model.
